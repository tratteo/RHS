Coding Conventions

SYNTHAX

Functions / Methods / Classes / Structs / Enums / Properties
Caps on each word letter
IE:
DrawTrajectoryLine(...)
CustomComponent
FieldStruct
LaunchType
NodeNumber

Fields
Initial low cap and then cap for all consecutive words
IE: launchProjectileVelocity

CLASSES ORDERING
Download and use CodeMaid for visual studio, it reorders the class evey time you save

1. Enums / Structs / Classes
2. public fields
3. editor exposed fields
4. private fields
5. properties
6. unity methods
7. methods
8. interfaces methods

CODING PATTERNS

1. Always make variables and methods private, use the public word only when strictly necessary. To expose variables to the inspector use [SerializeField]
2. Opt for getters and setters properties instead of exposing a public variable
3. If a field is read only, make a public get and private set property
4. DO NOT mess with spaghetti reference code. Access a reference of another script only when necessary and try to use the event listener pattern.
5. Modify the GibFrame library only if needed and ask Trat
6. The game development pattern used is: the consumed object is in charge to pass itself to the consumer.
   IE. when the donut collides with the cop, it gets a reference of the cop from the collider and pass itself to it
7. Do not write reduntant code and if possible always reuse existing code, better maintainability and bug fixing is easier
8. Every code structure aims to be modular, especially code describing behaviour that is sure to be expanded in future (ie. paths, cops, donuts)
